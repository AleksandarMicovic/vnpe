WHAT IS IT?
===========
A 2D sandbox where you can create objects, and share them in real
time with others. It's physics-enabled (Box2D), and the environment
has sane defaults for gravity, friction, etc. to start you off.
Flinging an object across the screen will appear on someone else's
browser, but only if they are connected with you.


WHAT'S DONE
===========
- Physics is 100% integrated now.
- Basic framework for creating shapes.
- Basic WebSocket infrastructure.
- The sending of data to other users.
- Creation of objects (right-clicking creates a random shape for now).


TODO
====
- Object UI, so that people can actually choose what to create instead
of having random objects spawn.
- Correct object appearing on another person's browser once arrived.
- Small bugs here and there.
